# Apache Airflow Example
This repository aims to provide an end to end example of [Apache Airflow](http://airflow.apache.org/index.html) for developers who are unfamiliar with it. Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Engineers can use airflow to create DAGs that execute tasks and visualize the pipeline.
